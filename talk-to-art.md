# Talk to Art - Product Design Document

## Overview
Talk to Art is an interactive platform that allows users to learn about artworks by taking photos of them in museums. The system uses computer vision and AI to identify artworks and enables natural voice conversations about the pieces.

## Implementation Features

### Feature 1: Image Upload Interface
**Goal**: Transform main page into a clean image upload interface

   - Remove existing search bar and example queries
   - Add centered image upload zone with drag-and-drop
   - Add "Take Photo" button for mobile users
   - Add upload progress indicator
   - Display preview of uploaded image
2. Backend Changes:
   - Create image upload endpoint
   - Add image validation (size, format, dimensions)
   - Implement temporary image storage
3. Testing:
   - Test various image formats and sizes
   - Verify mobile camera integration
   - Validate upload progress feedback

### Feature 2: Artwork Database Population Tool
**Goal**: Create admin interface for populating artwork database
1. Frontend Changes:
   - Create protected admin route
   - Build bulk upload interface for artwork images
   - Add form for artwork metadata:
     - Title
     - Artist
     - Description
     - Date
     - Location
     - Historical context
2. Backend Changes:
   - Set up artwork metadata schema
   - Create API endpoints for artwork CRUD operations
   - Implement batch processing for bulk uploads

### Feature 4: Voice Chat Interface
**Goal**: Enable voice conversations about artwork
1. Frontend Changes:
   - Add voice recording button
   - Implement audio streaming
   - Show transcription feedback
   - Display AI responses
2. Backend Changes:
   - Integrate speech-to-text service
   - Set up text-to-speech conversion
   - Create conversation management system
3. AI Integration:
   - Design prompt engineering for art context
   - Implement context management
   - Create fallback responses
